# Health-Conscious Grocery Trends: A Data Visualization Story
Exploring how fat content influences grocery sales and consumer choices using real-world delivery platform data.

---

## Overview
We often hear that people are becoming more health-conscious, but can we see that shift reflected in data?
This project delves into open-source grocery delivery data to examine sales trends based on Fat Content (low-fat vs. regular), Item Categories, and Outlet Locations (Tier 1–3 cities).

### Key Questions:
- Are low-fat items more popular than Regular ones?
- Does product visibility impact conversions?
- Are smaller cities driving the health trend too?

## Idea Behind This Project
This wasn’t a project I planned; it started with a ‘what if’ and ended with a dashboard full of quiet but clear signals. We're not just talking about health anymore, we're buying into it.
